Description of Assignment: The goal of this project was to write low level assembly procedures to perform the following function:

    - Prompt user to input a valid signed 32-bit integer; Take string input from the user
    
    - Validate that the input is a 32-bit signed integer, otherwise display error message and reobtain user input
    
    - Convert that string to an integer
    
    - Add that integer to an array and obtain more inputs until array is filled with 10 integers
    
    - Perform sum and average calculations with the 10 elements of the array
    
    - convert each integer element in array to a string
    
    - display string to user

Key Takeaways:

    - Modular design with assembly language
    
    - Macros and Procedures
    
    - Passing arguments on the system stack
    
    - Array manipulation
    
    - String primitives and byte processing
    
    - Indirect memory access using addresses (pointers)
    
    - Arithmetic with assembly language
